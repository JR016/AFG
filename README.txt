*********************************************************************************************************************************************


PD: IF YOU SEE A BUNCH OF "*" CHARACTERS THAT CONTAIN A BLOCK OF TEXT, IT MEANS THAT BLOCK OF TEXT IS VERY IMPORTANT (LIKE THIS ONE). 
SO, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THROUGH THE WHOLE FILE (BECAUSE YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO, "Mr OR Ms IMPORTANT I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.")
AT LEAST READ THE TEXT ENCAPSULATED BETWEEN THE "*" CHARACTERS.

YOU MUST AT LEAST READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS (THE REAL IMPORTANT ONES):

IMPORTANT FOR PROGRAMME FUNCTIONALITY
COPYRIGHT STUFF


IF YOU DON'T DO SO, THEN DO NOT EVEN THINK OF COMPLAINING BACK, TELLING ME THE PROGRAMME DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE 
YOU CHANGED THE LOCATION OF THE EXECUTABLE FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THAT WILL BE ONTO YOU, BUDDY.

FOLDER DESCRIPTION:


THE PROJECT FOLDER "AFEPG" CONTAINS:


"images" FOLDER: IMAGES USED IN THE PROGRAMME   (THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL FOLDER THAT CANNOT BE DELETED!!!!!)

"FG.exe" FILE: EXECUTABLE FILE TO RUN THE PROGRAMME   (IT HAS TO BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY/FOLDER AS THE "images" FOLDER.)

"FG.py" FILE: PYTHON FILE THAT CONTAINS THE SOURCE CODE OF THE PROGRAMME.   (HOW ALL THINGS ARE TIED TOGETHER.)

"common_GUI_functions.py" FILE: PYTHON FILE THAT CONTAINS FUNCTIONS BASED ON TKINTER FOR POP-UPS AND WIDGETS. (IT'S USED ACROSS SEVERAL OTHER FILES).

"MainFrame.py" FILE: PYTHON FILE THAT CONTAINS THE MAIN FRAME CLASS OF THE MAIN PROGRAMME.

"Little_Top.py" FILE: PYTHON FILE THAT CONTAINS THE FRAME CLASS OF THE TOP LEVEL WINDOW OF THE MAIN PROGRAMME.

"enhancedTk.py" FILE: PYTHON FILE THAT CONTAINS AN IMPROVED CLASS OF THE Tk() TKINTER WINDOW OBJECT AND AN IMPROVED Toplevel() WINDOW TKINTER OBJECT (IMPROVED ACCORDING TO ME, OBVIOUSLY >:) )

"FileManager.py" FILE: PYTHON FILE THAT CONTAINS A CLASS TO CREATE FILES AND DO MORE STUFF WITH THEM IF THE USER WANTS TO.  (VERY IMPORTANT CLASS.)

"README.md" FILE: EMPTY FILE THAT GITHUB REQUIRES, DELETE IT. IT IS UNCESSESARY.

"README.txt" FILE: THIS FILE :) :) :).


********************************************************************************************************************************************************
********************************************************************************************************************************************************

IMPORTANT FOR PROGRAMME FUNCTIONALITY: 


DO NOT ELIMINATE THE "images" FOLDER, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

DO NOT MOVE THE "FG.exe" FILE TO ANOTHER FOLDER WITHOUT THE "images" FOLDER ALONG WITH IT, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THE IMAGE FILES LOCATED WITHIN THE "images" FOLDER, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF ANY OF THE IMAGE FILES WITHIN THE "images" FOLDER, OTHERWISE THE PROGRAMME WILL NOT RUN.

IF YOU SWITCH THE NAME OF THE IMAGE FILES WITHIN THE "images" FOLDER, THE PROGRAMME WILL EITHER NOT RUN OR WILL SHOW IMAGES IN THE WRONG PLACE.

IF YOU DO NOT SPECIFY  "Location" IN THE PROGRAMME, THE PROJECT WILL BE CREATED IN THE "AFG" FOLDER.


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************
*********************************************************************************************************************************************************

NOTE: 


PYTHON FILES WILL NOT RUN IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PYTHON 3 INTERPRETER INSTALLED IN YOUR COMPUTER.
IF YOU OPEN THEM USING A TEXT EDITOR LIKE "Notepad" OR "TextEdit" THEY WILL SHOW YOU THE SOURCE CODE THAT I WROTE FOR THE "AFG"
(YOU ARE ALREADY A FRIEND AT THIS STAGE OF THE FILE :) ).

I CREATED THE PROGRAMME IN WINDOWS 10, SO I AM NOT SURE IF IT WORKS IN OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS, LET'S FIND OUT :)

YOU CAN DELETE THE PYTHON FILES IF YOU WANT TO, THEY WILL NOT AFFECT THE MAIN EXECUTABLE FILE.
I INCLUDED THEM SO YOU CAN REVIEW THEM AND ADD NEW FEATURES TO THE PROGRAMME IF YOU WANT TO.
